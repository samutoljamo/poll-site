# poll-site
Deployed to heroku: https://my-poll-site.herokuapp.com/ \
You can create polls, vote and look at the results\
Frontend: Typescript/React\
Backend: Typescript/Express

## Todo:
- ~~Mongodb(currently polls are saved on memory)~~ (Done)
- Client/Serverside checks on titles/options since they can be empty right now
- Client feels annoying to use since it renders components, which do not require a request to the backend, before the components that wait for the server to send a response
